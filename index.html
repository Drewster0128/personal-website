                    Hello, my name is Andrew Cook and I am a second year undergraduate at Illinois Institute of Technology working on a bachlors degree in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created this site to inform any potential employers about myself in a more in-depth way than a resume. It also showcases my abilites in HTML and CSS. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am lucky to have such a wonderful family consisting of my parents, Steve and Laurie, and my sisters, Stephanie and Paige. I can honestly say that I wouldn't be where I am currently without their guidence and support. We also have a massive dog named Bentley. He gets so excited around new faces that we sometimes forgets how big he is, but he's full of love.
                </p>
